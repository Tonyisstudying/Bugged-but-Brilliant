            Hi! I’m Jade (nickname: 🦊 Foxy), but people also call me Jadie,
            Ngoc (my Vietnamese name， and yupp I come from this beautiful
            country- Vietnam), 武碧玉 (my Chinese name), Aoi (my Japanese name),
            or Yuju (my Korean name) — thanks to some work requirements, I ended
            up with a bunch of names in different languages 😅. I’m currently a
            Computer Science student with student id of 1820242155 at Beijing
            Institute of Technology 💻. I love cybersecurity and I play CTF. I’m
            ridiculously over-ambitious 🚀… and a bit hot-tempered 🔥. My
            quoties: “Nothing is ever enough” 💫 and “Inspired by beauty and
            brain” 🧠💖. Studying and working are always my top priorities 📚✨.
            I’m just trying my best to learn, grow, and have fun along the way
            ✨. If you ever cross paths with me online or offline, I hope you’ll
            cheer me on a little, laugh with me :>
