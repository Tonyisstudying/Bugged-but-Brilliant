        <h3>1. Fundamentals</h3>
        <p>
          A computer network is a system of interconnected devices that
          communicate and share resources using standard protocols. Its goals
          include enabling communication, sharing resources like files and
          printers, ensuring reliability through redundancy, supporting
          scalability, and optimizing efficiency. Networks consist of end
          devices (PCs, laptops, smartphones, servers), networking devices
          (routers, switches, hubs, access points, firewalls), and transmission
          media (wired or wireless). Communication is governed by protocols such
          as TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, and FTP. Key models include OSI (7 layers) and
          TCP/IP (4 layers), which define functions from physical transmission
          to application-level communication. Networks vary in scale from PAN,
          LAN, MAN, WAN to enterprise networks.

        <h3>2. Subfields of Computer Networks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>2.1 Network Architecture & Protocols:</strong> Defines
            network design (centralized vs decentralized) and communication
            rules, including TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, email protocols, DNS,
            and routing protocols like BGP, OSPF, and RIP.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.2 Routing & Switching:</strong> Switching operates on MAC
            addresses (Layer 2) and includes Ethernet, VLAN, STP; routing
            operates on IP addresses (Layer 3), finding optimal paths through
            static or dynamic protocols. NAT translates private to public IPs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.3 Wireless & Mobile Networking:</strong> Covers Wi-Fi,
            mobile networks (3G/4G/5G), Bluetooth, NFC, ad hoc and mesh
            networks, and mobility management via Mobile IP.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.4 Network Security:</strong> Addresses malware, DoS/DDoS,
            MITM, spoofing, and phishing using firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs,
            encryption, and zero-trust principles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.5 Cloud & Data Center Networking:</strong> Focuses on
            large-scale infrastructures, SDN/NFV for virtualization, virtual
            networking with VMs/containers, and load balancing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.6 IoT Networking:</strong> Connects everyday devices
            (sensors, cameras, appliances) using lightweight protocols (MQTT,
            CoAP) and low-power wireless technologies (ZigBee, Z-Wave, LoRaWAN),
            with challenges in scalability and security.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.7 Performance & QoS:</strong> Measured by bandwidth,
            latency, jitter, and packet loss; optimized through congestion
            control, traffic shaping, scheduling, and service differentiation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.8 Network Management & Monitoring:</strong> Involves
            configuration, fault detection, performance measurement, and
            security auditing using SNMP, traffic analysis tools, monitoring
            software, and automation frameworks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.9 Emerging Areas:</strong> Includes 6G networking, quantum
            networking, satellite networks, AI-driven networking, and edge/fog
            computing.
