                    <div class="era-details">
                        <p>Long before electronic circuits, innovators pursued mechanical and electromechanical ways to automate calculation. Charles Babbage's designs‚Äîfrom the Difference Engine to the concept of the Analytical Engine in the 1830s‚Äîforeshadowed the stored program, punched-card input, and conditional branching that define modern computing. Meanwhile, the Jacquard loom used punch cards in the early 19th century to encode weaving patterns, directly inspiring how punched cards would later serve in data processing and programming. Herman Hollerith transformed census tabulation in the late 1800s by combining punched cards with electromechanical tabulators, enabling faster, cheaper processing and eventually forming the business roots of IBM. Collectively, these developments laid the conceptual and commercial foundation critical to the rise of electronic computing.</p>

                    <div class="era-details">
                        <p>The first truly electronic, digital, general-purpose computers emerged in this era. ENIAC, completed in 1945, featured around 18,000 vacuum tubes and could perform 5,000 additions per second‚Äîits assembly by six women programmers and groundbreaking performance marked a leap in computing. These machines operated via complex rewiring, plugboards, and switch settings, consuming vast amounts of power and generating intense heat, making them fragile and costly to maintain. Despite these limitations, they proved electronic computation's viability, leading to early commercial systems like UNIVAC I and IBM's 701, setting in motion broader acceptance of digital machinery.</p>

                        <p>Transistors replaced bulky vacuum tubes, resulting in machines that were smaller, more reliable, and less power-hungry. This hardware shift coincided with a software revolution: high-level languages like FORTRAN and COBOL enabled abstractions away from binary or assembly code, bringing programming into the hands of engineers and business users. Core memory types (e.g., magnetic cores) improved speed and access, while systems like the IBM 1401 became staples in organizations, accelerating computing's business adoption.</p>

                        <p>Integrated circuits packed multiple transistors into compact chips, dramatically reducing size and cost while boosting performance. The launch of IBM's System/360 introduced an architecture capable of scaling across different performance levels while maintaining software compatibility‚Äîa first-of-its-kind approach. Around the same time the PDP-8 opened computing doors for smaller businesses and universities. ICs also enabled interactive computing via time-sharing and multiprogramming, and operating systems and widely used high-level languages evolved, setting the stage for software-driven innovation.</p>

                        <p>The entire CPU's components were placed on a single chip beginning with Intel's 4004 in 1971‚Äîa watershed moment that democratized computing. Hobbyist platforms like the Altair 8800 led to a movement culminating in iconic home computers such as the Apple II and later the IBM PC, giving rise to widespread desktop computing. During this era, GUIs, networking foundations, and software ecosystems flourished, empowering individuals and businesses to own and develop for their own machines.</p>
